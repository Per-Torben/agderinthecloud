.SYNOPSIS
    Get all OneDrive sites in the tenant and list them in a table with the Name, Owner, and NameUnderscore properties.
.DESCRIPTION
    This script gets all OneDrive sites in the tenant and lists them in a table with the Name, Owner, and NameUnderscore properties.
    The script uses the PnP PowerShell module to connect to the SharePoint Admin site and get all OneDrive sites.
    The script then creates a custom object with the Name, Owner, and NameUnderscore properties and adds it to an array.
    The script outputs the array to the console.
    The script also clears the console and writes a message to the console.
